# TriangleJump
The fourth game I have created, it is based on Doodle Jump. In it I added new things like SaveGame, Particle System (created by me) and Animations. I made a difficulty system that makes the more points you have the less chance of easier things, etc. I also made my own Triangle physics which can be easily changed. Although this game doesn't look like but it took a long time to make for game like this and its because many things are not visible here, such as What if the platform resists too high? What if the broken platform respawns for a few times etc. and such things took the longest time
<br/>The game was created in 20 days. (from 31.12.2021 to 20.01.2022)
